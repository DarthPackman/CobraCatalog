        <h1>About Cobramode</h1>
        <p>
            CobraMode Miniatures creates unique, fun, and artistic sculpts every month for home 3d printing, tabletop
            gaming, and hobby painting!
            They are Erin and Andrea, two creative professionals making 3D models for tabletop games.
            Both of them have worked in video games, Erin as a 3D artist and Andrea as a 2D artist.
            Using there love of character design, they created a Patreon to make 3d printable miniatures for your D&D
            adventures, armies, or collections.

        <h1>Eye for balance, silhouette, and detail</h1>
        <p>
            As artists who have worked with both traditional and digital media, They try their best to put artistic
            principles into action with each sculpt, paying attention to the silhouette, sense of weight and balance,
            and special character details that make each piece a work of art.
            Erin’s unique sculpting style and ideas blend together with Andrea’s concepts for details and poses to
            create a collaborative character full of life!

        <h1>Professional Pre-Supports</h1>
        <p>
            All their minis come with both pre-supported and unsupported versions, so you can just slice and print.
            They also have a dedicated Support channel in their Discord to help you with troubleshooting and dialing in
            settings to get perfect minis every time.
            Their supports blend printability with ease of removal, and leave little to no damage on the fine details of
            the sculpts.
            All their newer files are tested by Atlas3D, who provides editable. LYS support files in case you want to
            change the supports to better suit your printer and resin.
            They also have D&D 5E Stats for each mini (currently catching up from January to May as their Statmaker, Ben
            Green, is on temporary hiatus).
            Use the lore and backstory snippets to guide your campaigns, and use the unique custom stat blocks to create
            fun and original encounters!
            To see all the lore in one place, read the CobraCompendium guide which details the setting of the CobraMode
            Universe.

        <h1>Vibrant Community of Artist & Painters</h1>
        <p>
            Their patrons say that they have the friendliest miniatures Discord around, and they believe it.
            They have an active community of 3d modelers, artists, and painters in their channel, all ready to share
            their
            paints, comments/critiques, and tips.
            They also have our Cobra Corps Painting Club, which picks a CobraMode miniature each month to paint together
            weekly!
            They're so happy to provide a space where creative people can interact with each other, and it’s also a
            great
            space to ask them questions about 3d modeling, get feedback on your art, or just show off your latest work.
